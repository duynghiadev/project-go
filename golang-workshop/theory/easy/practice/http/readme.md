### Mini-Lesson: Introduction to the net/http Package in Go

#### Overview
The `net/http` package in Go provides facilities for building HTTP servers and clients. It allows you to handle HTTP requests, create web servers, and interact with web services.

#### Key Components
1. **Server**: The `http.Server` struct represents an HTTP server. It listens for incoming requests on a specified network address and port.
2. **Handler**: Handlers process incoming HTTP requests. They implement the `http.Handler` interface, which includes a method `ServeHTTP` to handle requests.
3. **Request**: The `http.Request` struct represents an HTTP request received by the server. It contains information such as the request method, URL, headers, and body.
4. **Response**: The `http.ResponseWriter` interface represents the HTTP response that will be sent to the client. It allows you to write response headers and body.

#### Basic Server Example
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/hello", helloHandler)
    fmt.Println("Server is running on port 8080...")
    err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error starting server:", err)
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
- We import the `net/http` package.
- We define a handler function `helloHandler` that writes "Hello, World!" to the response writer.
- We use `http.HandleFunc` to register the handler function for the `/hello` route.
- We start the HTTP server using `http.ListenAndServe` on port 8080.
